	<h1>Who am I?</h1>
	<p>My name is Andreas Otto Brage, i am 24 years old and come from Elsinore.
	The reason i decided to become a multimedia designer is because i enjoy creating
	new things, and editing existing things. I have also always enjoyed a nice layout
	and awesome user interface on different websites which motivates me to learn
	new things, and bring my own ideas to life.<br><br>
    The multimedia design line gives me the opportunity to link all of those things 
	together, to make something new and inovative, but learn it from the beginning,
	all the way from writing basic code, and editing light on pictures.<br><br>
	I hope you enjoyed my website, and feel free to contact me if you have any
	enquiries.<br><br>
    Best regards.<br><br>
    Andreas Otto Brage</p>
